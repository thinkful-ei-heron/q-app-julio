Notes for pre-requisite day 05

Avoid spaghetti code: which is - unstructured and difficult to maintain source code. 

it becomes important to seperate out your code into disticnt functions that have narrow, specific responsabilities. 

user-stories: short, plain, language descriptions of what your app does. 
  ex: user-stories for our shopping list app.
    - A shopping list should be rendered to the page
    - You should be able to add items to the list
    - You should be able to check items on the list
    - You should be able to delete items from the list

spaghetti code doesn't scale. do your best to write small and clear functions and code. Always imagine someone else is picking up after you to finish.

don't just start to write code at the beginning of a project. BAD IDEA.


converting user-stories to function stubs

pseudocode: code that is intended for human reading and not the computer reading.
